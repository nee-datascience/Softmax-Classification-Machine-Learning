# Softmax-Classification-Machine-Learning-

Using gradient descent (a common machine learning technique) to train and perform prediction on the iris dataset.

Goal:
Based on the training dataset, we aim at doing prediction on the test dataset.

For the data we will be dealing with, there will be 3 labels: ’setosa', 'versicolor' and ‘virginica'.

We will have to implement an algorithm to predict the correct label based on the given data attributes, namely, the values of sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width. This is a classification problem. To solve the problem, you will need to implement a particular model. We will use softmax regression (which is similar to logistic regression, but generalises to multi-classes) and do gradient descent.

Overview:
Stage 1: getting the desired data from the raw data
Stage 2: training the model based on the training data we got from stage 1
Stage 3: predicting and testing accuracy based on the trained model from stage 2
Stage 4: using the sklearn library to evaluate the accuracy at which sklearn performs.
